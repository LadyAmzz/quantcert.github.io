An article on the formalization and validation of a block design construction method by a Magma program was submitted to participate in the eighteenth AFADL days. This article was co-written by Jessy Colonval and Henri de Boutray.

**Abstract:**
In the domain of experimental mathematics, the programs used to obtaining various results rarely follow the principles of software engineering, which is why which makes these results difficult to replicate and evaluate. This article presents a formalization of a method for building structures combinatorial (called "block systems") and a validation of their properties.
